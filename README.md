  ##change the status of the tasks
  ## Trace the complete and uncompleted  tasks

## Tech Stack
##Client Side:
# Next.js: Next.js is a React framework that provides server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and other advanced features for building modern web applications. It helps in creating fast and optimized client-side experiences.

# Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to rapidly build custom user interfaces. It provides a set of pre-defined utility classes that can be used to style your components and create responsive designs.

# Mobx State Tree (MST): Mobx State Tree is a state management library that helps in managing the state of your application. It provides a structured and intuitive way to define your application's data model and handles state changes efficiently.

## Server:
# MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable solution for storing and retrieving data. It allows you to store data in a JSON-like format, making it easy to work with for JavaScript-based applications.

#Express.js: Express.js is a minimalistic and flexible Node.js framework that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs. It provides a set of robust features and middleware for handling HTTP requests, routing, and more.

# Nodemon: Nodemon is a development tool that automatically restarts your Node.js application when changes are detected. It helps in speeding up the development process by eliminating the need to manually restart the server after code modifications.

These technologies work together to create a full-stack web application where Next.js handles the client-side rendering, Tailwind CSS provides styling capabilities, MST manages the application state, MongoDB acts as the database, Express.js handles server-side logic, and Nodemon facilitates the development process by auto-restarting the server.
